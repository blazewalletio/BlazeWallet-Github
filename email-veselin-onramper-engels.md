Subject: Request: Complete Documentation Package for Onramper Integration

Hi Veselin,

I hope you're doing well.

We're currently working on implementing Onramper into our Blaze Wallet application and are encountering some challenges with URL signing for the widget integration.

**Our situation:**
- Production API Key: `pk_prod_01KBJCSS9G727A14XA544DSS7D`
- We're trying to implement widget URL signing according to the documentation at https://docs.onramper.com/docs/signatures/widget-sign-a-url
- We're getting a "Signature validation failed" error with all our attempts

**Our request:**
Would it be possible to receive a complete text file or PDF with all relevant documentation for the Onramper implementation? This would be extremely helpful for us because we would then:
1. Have all information in one place
2. Be able to reference it more easily during implementation
3. Be certain we're not missing anything

Specifically, we're interested in:
- Widget integration (URL signing, parameters, etc.)
- API integration (endpoints, authentication, etc.)
- Webhook setup
- Best practices and examples
- Any Node.js/JavaScript code examples

**Alternative:**
If a complete document isn't available, could you help us with:
1. The secret key for URL signing (we understand this is a separate key, not the API key)
2. A working code example for URL signing in Node.js/JavaScript
3. Any other documentation we might be missing

We greatly appreciate your help and look forward to successfully integrating Onramper into our wallet.

Best regards,
